**OPERATORS**

JavaScript supports various operators, which are symbols used to perform operations on operands (values or variables). Here's an overview of the different types of operators in JavaScript:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**: Used to perform mathematical calculations.

   - Addition `+`
   - Subtraction `-`
   - Multiplication `*`
   - Division `/`
   - Modulus `%` (returns the remainder of a division)
   - Increment `++` (adds 1 to a variable)
   - Decrement `--` (subtracts 1 from a variable)

2. **Assignment Operators**: Used to assign values to variables.

   - Assignment `=`
   - Addition assignment `+=`
   - Subtraction assignment `-=`
   - Multiplication assignment `*=`
   - Division assignment `/=`
   - Modulus assignment `%=`

3. **Comparison Operators**: Used to compare values.

   - Equal to `==`
   - Strict equal to `===` (checks both value and type)
   - Not equal to `!=`
   - Strict not equal to `!==`
   - Greater than `>`
   - Less than `<`
   - Greater than or equal to `>=`
   - Less than or equal to `<=`

4. **Logical Operators**: Used to perform logical operations.

   - Logical AND `&&`
   - Logical OR `||`
   - Logical NOT `!`

5. **Unary Operators**: Operates on a single operand.

   - Unary plus `+` (converts an operand into a number)
   - Unary minus `-` (negates an operand)
   - Increment `++` (adds 1 to a variable)
   - Decrement `--` (subtracts 1 from a variable)

6. **Ternary Operator (Conditional Operator)**: Used for decision-making.

   - Syntax: `condition ? expr1 : expr2`
   - If `condition` is true, `expr1` is executed; otherwise, `expr2` is executed.

7. **String Operators**:

   - Concatenation `+`: Joins two or more strings together.

8. **Type Operators**:

   - typeof: Returns the data type of a variable or expression.
   - instanceof: Returns true if an object is an instance of a specified object type.

9. **Bitwise Operators**: Perform bitwise operations on binary representations of numbers.
   - Bitwise AND `&`
   - Bitwise OR `|`
   - Bitwise XOR `^`
   - Bitwise NOT `~`
   - Left shift `<<`
   - Right shift `>>`
   - Zero-fill right shift `>>>`

These operators enable you to perform a wide range of operations, from simple arithmetic calculations to complex logical evaluations, making JavaScript a versatile language for programming.
